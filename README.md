Schematics is largely copied from and inspired by Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit LE
https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406
https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/introduction

and Redbear BLE Nano v2

https://github.com/redbear/nRF5x/tree/master/nRF52832

so that Arduino BSP developed by Adafruit or Redbear could be used as well as SDK from Nordic.
(Personally I'd recommend to go with Adafruit now that Redbear joined Particle)
